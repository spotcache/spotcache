## Hi there 👋

I am spotcache.

okay no wait, it's actually Arjun.

I do something with these different "languages",

or so they call it, and make weird things.

Then came along AI's which I absolutely ADORE!.

I'm all in for machine learning and alike.

Tip: Private AI can be set-up on your machine,

and that's what I've done too!

It's really cool to see that how these tools help me,

and countless others make awesome stuff.

And being able to share it..!, that's the best part!.

I guess I'm not so great at intros'

reach out for questions.
